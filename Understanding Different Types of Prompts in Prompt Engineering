Zero Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting is a technique in natural language processing where a language model is asked to perform a task or generate a response for which it hasn't been trained. Instead of providing specific examples, a general instruction or description is given. This allows the model to leverage its existing knowledge and understanding to perform the task in new scenarios. For instance, asking a language model the capital of France without training it specifically on that question. Zero-shot prompting enables models to generalize and handle a variety of queries and tasks.

Example:
What is the capital of New Jersey

Single Shot Prompting

Definition: Single Shot Prompting is a technique in which a single, succinct prompt is given to a language model to generate a specific response. Rather than overwhelming the model with extensive instructions, this approach focuses on precision and relevance.
Examples:
1. Poetry Generation: Instead of detailed instructions, a single shot prompt like “Compose a romantic poem about the moon” can yield beautiful verses.
2. Coding Challenges: For coding tasks, a concise problem statement such as “Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci series” guides the model effectively.
Remember, single shot prompts streamline communication and enhance model performance by providing clear, targeted input.

Example:
"Describe the Eifel Tower in three sentences"

Few Shot Prompting

Definition: Few Shot Prompting is a technique where a model is given limited additional information or “shots” to enhance its performance. Instead of overwhelming the model with extensive context, this approach provides concise input.
Examples:
3. Text Summarization: Offering a brief summary of an article as a “shot” to generate a condensed version.
4. Image Captioning: Providing a single descriptive sentence about an image to prompt the model for relevant captions.
Remember, few shot prompting streamlines communication and allows models to perform effectively with minimal input.

More Examples 
Write a poem in the style of William Wordsworth about the beauty of nature.

Example:
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils

Chain of Thought Reasoning
Definition: Chain of Thought Reasoning is a technique used to break down tasks and enhance the reasoning skills of the LLM (Language Learning Model). 
It is particularly effective for handling complex math questions. Additionally, this approach aids in reducing hallucinations.
Examples:
5. Math Problem Solving: When faced with a complex math problem, breaking it down step by step allows the model to reason through each component.
6. Text Generation: For generating coherent paragraphs, the chain of thought approach ensures logical flow and minimizes irrelevant content.
Remember, chaining thoughts systematically improves model performance and reduces cognitive noise.

For Example:
Who was the most decorated (maximum medals) individual athlete in the Olympic games that were held at Sydney? Take a step-by-step approach in your response, 
cite sources and give reasoning before sharing final answer in the below format: ANSWER is

Iterative Prompting
Definition: Iterative Prompting is a technique where a model is given limited additional information or “shots” to enhance its performance. 
Instead of overwhelming the model with extensive context, this approach provides concise input.
Examples:
7. Text Summarization: Offering a brief summary of an article as a “shot” to generate a condensed version.
8. Image Captioning: Providing a single descriptive sentence about an image to prompt the model for relevant captions.
Remember, iterative prompting streamlines communication and allows models to perform effectively with minimal input.
