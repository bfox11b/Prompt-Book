"Offering context is crucial when it comes to AI. Just like humans, AI performs better when it has a clear understanding of the subject matter. For instance, if you want to write about the importance of AI in technology, you could tailor your prompt to be more specific, such as: 'Write a document about the importance of AI in technology, particularly in Microsoft technology, and how it benefits both technical and non-technical individuals.'

Another example would be to improve a basic prompt like 'Write about AI' to something more specific like 'Write a blog post about the importance of AI in the current technology field and its relevance to other professions.' By adding context, you can guide the AI to produce a more targeted and relevant response.
There are also some handy expressions that can help you achieve certain outcomes when working with AI. For example, using phrases like 'Let's think step by step' can help the AI think logically, which can be particularly useful when solving math problems. Similarly, using the phrase 'Thinking backwards' can help the AI arrive at more accurate conclusions. You can also use phrases like 'In the style of [famous person]' to help the AI match a particular writing style, or 'As a [insert profession/role]' to frame the AI's knowledge and understanding of a particular subject.

In addition to providing context and using specific expressions, you can also help the AI by providing additional information about the subject matter. For example, if you want the AI to write about the importance of AI in technology, you could provide some relevant information about the subject to help the AI tailor its response. Another way to help the AI is by summarizing content into a format that is easier to comprehend. For example, you could summarize the definition of AI as 'the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.'"

• "Explain like I'm five": This phrase can help the AI simplify complex concepts and explain them in a way that is easy to understand, even for someone with no prior knowledge of the subject.
• "In layman's terms": Similar to the previous expression, this phrase can help the AI explain technical or complex concepts in simple, everyday language.
• "Be creative": This phrase can encourage the AI to generate more imaginative and original content, such as stories, poems, or artwork.
• "Be concise": This phrase can help the AI generate more succinct and to-the-point responses, which can be particularly useful when you need a quick and straightforward answer.
• "Be formal": This phrase can help the AI generate responses that are more formal and professional in tone, which can be useful when writing business emails or academic papers.
• "Be humorous": This phrase can help the AI generate responses that are more lighthearted and humorous, which can be useful when you want to add some levity to a conversation or a piece of writing.
