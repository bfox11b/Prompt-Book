This prompt book is meant to go over the fundamentals of effective Prompting from a Prompt Engineer perspective. 

This will give some background into how to develop an effective prompt.   Also keep in mind that this really isn't that difficult a concept to grasp in the end…. Especially when it comes to Copilot.

If there is one section in this notebook I would stress folks to look at it would be the Learning and Concepts this particular section will give you a base understanding of the concepts of building an effective prompt that can be used ANYWHERE and with ANY GPT Tool….Azure OpenAI (AOAI), ChatGPT, Bing Copilot, M365 Copilots, etc.

This is a WIP so I generally will add prompts and information as I develop them and test that they work for me and come across useful links and information.

As I work on this project, I will continue to add new ideas and information. I'll be testing everything to make sure it works for me and including any useful links and information that I come across.

Sharing is Caring….. Good luck in your journey

Feel free to reach me directly if you have any questions or ideas you would like to have added.
