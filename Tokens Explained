When we talk about tokens in the context of natural language processing, they usually refer to words or individual characters. For example, if you have the sentence "I love cats," it can be broken down into four tokens: "I," "love," "cats," and the punctuation mark ",".

Tokens are important because they serve as the building blocks for various language-based tasks. By breaking down text into tokens, we can analyze and process it more easily. Tokens allow us to understand the structure of a sentence, extract important information, perform searches, and perform many other operations.

In programming languages, tokens are used to represent the smallest units of code. These can be keywords, identifiers, operators, punctuation symbols, or any other meaningful element in the programming language. Tokens help the compiler or interpreter understand the code and perform the necessary actions.

To summarize, tokens are like the Lego blocks of text or code. They represent small, meaningful units that allow us to work with and understand language and programming. By breaking down text or code into tokens, we can analyze, manipulate, and process them more effectively.
This response isn't based on the selected text: Sure, here are some suggestions for improving the content and examples on a page about code tokens:
	• Provide a clear definition of what code tokens are and how they are used in programming languages.
	• Include examples of code tokens in different programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C++.
	• Explain the role of code tokens in lexical analysis and how they are used by compilers and interpreters.
	• Include visual aids, such as diagrams or flowcharts, to help readers understand the concepts better.
	• Provide exercises or quizzes for readers to test their understanding of the material.


Some additional examples:

According to the current section: Tokens are the smallest units of text that carry meaning. They are used to break down text into smaller, more manageable pieces for analysis and processing. 
Here are some examples to help you understand how words are broken down into tokens:
	• Example 1: The sentence 'I have a cat' can be tokenized into four tokens: 'I', 'have', 'a', and 'cat'.
	• Example 2: The sentence 'She is happy.' can be tokenized into four tokens: 'She', 'is', 'happy', and '.'.
	• Example 3: The sentence 'I like ice-cream' can be tokenized into four tokens: 'I', 'like', 'ice-cream'. In each of these examples, the words and punctuation marks are separated into individual tokens. This makes it easier to analyze and process the text.
